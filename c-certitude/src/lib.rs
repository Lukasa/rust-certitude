// A C-ABI compatible version of the cert validation function. It does some work to transform the data,
// and then just calls the cert validation function from certitude.
//
// Here are the rules for calling this from C.
// - encoded_certs is an array of pointers to DER-encoded representations of the certificates in the
//   certificate chain. Neither the pointer array nor the DER-encoded representations of the certs
//   are null-terminated.
// - cert_sizes is an array of lengths for each DER-encoded cert. This array has the exact same length
//   as the array in encoded_certs. These lengths must not include any null-terminators that may be at
//   the end of the DER-encoded certs.
// - cert_count is the number of elements in both the encoded_certs and cert_sizes array.
// - hostname is the UTF-8 encoded hostname to validate the cert chain against. This string must be
//   null-terminated.
//
// Rust takes ownership of none of these objects: where necessary it makes its own copies, but
// generally speaking it expects all of the data passed to be it to remain valid for the duration
// of the function call. The caller retains ownership, however, and is responsible for freeing all
// the relevant data.
