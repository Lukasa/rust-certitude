#![deny(warnings)]
//! Functions for validating certificates on many platforms.
//!
//! Certitude focuses on making it possible to validate a chain of X.509 certificates used
//! for a TLS connection by using the appropriate platform-specific logic, rather than by
//! relying on the TLS library that actually makes the connection. This approach is useful
//! for libraries that want to use OpenSSL build TLS connections on Windows and OS X, but
//! that want to exhibit "platform-native" behaviour on those systems.
//!
//! Currently Certitude *only* supports Windows and OS X: it explicitly does not support
//! Linux or any other Unix, where it is expected that the verification logic provided by
//! OpenSSL (or the appropriate TLS library) used on those systems will be used instead.
//! As that library is likely the one responsible for actually handling the TLS logic, it
//! is likely pretty easy to use the built-in validation logic.

// TODO: Widen "NotTrusted".

/// Possible results from attempting to validate a certificate chain.
///
/// When attempting to validate a certificate chain, in addition to the two "successful"
/// results (`ValidationResult::Trusted` and `ValidationResult::NotTrusted`), there are
/// numerous possible error conditions. This enum allows for expressing those error
/// conditions.
///
/// Note that due to the vagaries of the system libraries, it is possible that a
/// misleading error may be generated: for example, the hostname may be malformed
/// but in a manner that does not immediate generate a `ValidationResult::MalformedHostname`
/// result. That's unfortunate, but there is relatively little that can be done about that
/// in the absence of clearer system APIs.
